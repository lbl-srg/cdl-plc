This folder contains templates for different parts / snippets for the IEC 61131-10 XML in two folders:
1. structure: snippets for the general structure (programs, blocks, inputs, outputs etc.) of an IEC 61131-10 XML
2. function_blocks: snippets for CDL blocks in IEC 61131-3 code. Note: If available, blocks are directly taken from the IEC library, for example ADD.
